#*Intern Project Statement:*
Write a menu-driven interactive console based C++ application to perform geometric shapes
manipulations. There has to be provision for respective calculations of 2-D as well as 3-D shapes. For
2-D shapes area and perimeter and for 3-D shapes surface area and volume etc. parameters are to be
calculated by accepting respective input parameters of the shape.
Add the facilities to maintain all shapes data, such that it should be possible to search for a particular
shape, update any input parameter of a shape, delete any unwanted shape and display all shapes in
the order of area or perimeter for 2D shape and volume or surface area for the 3D shapes.
